# Open-Source-Train-Controller
***CURRENTLY JUST A COLLECTION OF PARTS AND CODE FOR THOSE INTERESTED***
This is a collection of 3d print files, parts, and code to make a functional train controller for PC games.  
There are no instructions for this yet, but the parts are named well enough where I believe you can figure it out.
THIS IS A KEYBOARD EMULATOR, it does not work on the same system as a RailDriver

**REQUIRED ELECTRONICS**
Arduino Leanardo or other USB PROTOCOL CAPABLE MICROCONTROLLERS.  An Arduino Uno WILL NOT WORK
7 Cherry MX brown switches (other colors will work if you wish to have a different feel)
3 potentiometers (6 if you want the light dials) - I used DigiKeym part number  PDB12-H4301-103BF-ND for the potentiometers.  The length is important, keep that in mind.
