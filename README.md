# Open-Source-Train-Controller
***CURRENTLY JUST A COLLECTION OF PARTS AND CODE FOR THOSE INTERESTED***
I do not guarantee that this works, but these are the files I made it with,

***If you edit these files and improve upon them, which I highly encourage, please credit me in any re-uploads***
This is a collection of 3d print files, parts, and code to make a functional train controller for PC games.  
There are no instructions for this yet, but the parts are named well enough where I believe you can figure it out.
THIS IS A KEYBOARD EMULATOR, it does not work on the same system as a RailDriver

**REQUIRED ELECTRONICS**
Arduino Leanardo or other USB PROTOCOL CAPABLE MICROCONTROLLERS.  An Arduino Uno WILL NOT WORK
7 Cherry MX brown switches (other colors will work if you wish to have a different feel)
3 potentiometers (6 if you want the light dials) - I used DigiKeym part number  PDB12-H4301-103BF-ND for the potentiometers.  The length is important, keep that in mind.
N52 Neodynium magnets, 5mm diameter, 2mm thick
superglue, wires, and a couple breadboards
micro USB cable
Side note: throw a piece of cork roadbed under the brake lever wheel so it doesn't fall down under it's own weight

**CURRENT FUNCTIONS**
BASED ON RAIL SIM UNIVERSE FUNCTIONS< NOT TESTED WITH ANY OTHER SIMULATOR
-Horn (no quil)
-Bell
-Sand Momentary
-Sand On/Off toggle
-Door function (button press)
-conductor buzz (button press)
-Throttle - 8 notched
-Automatic brake - smooth with emergency brake at max application
-there are holes in the front plate for light dials, but I never actually built the mechanism or code for these.  Use the same potentiometers as before and have fun making it.

**PRINTING**
I think all the parts are here.  You will need to cut up these parts and slice them yourself.  Many parts are too big to actually print in one piece, but it isn't too hard to split them up in a slicer software
I used Bambu PLA and printed in the desired color.  Printer was a Bambu Lab P1S, and took the majority of a three day weekend to print all of the parts.
